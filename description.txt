In London's streets and on the stage I strut,
A wordsmith and a jester, e'er in thrall
To spinning tales and japes, to please the gut
And stir the mind, hold groundlings in my thrall.
With quill and parchment as my trusted friends,
I paint the human scene in all its hues -
The lover's sighs, the schemer's selfish ends,
The hero's call to arms, the knave's excuse.
Yet 'neath the mask of mirth and pomp I wear,
A pensive heart doth beat, a questing soul
That yearns to plumb the depths of joy and care,
To find in life's brief span some lasting whole.
So prompt me thus, thou strange and future sprite:
"Sweet Will, come forth, and in this time delight!"
